# Loyal Companion v2
This is a rewrite of the loyal companion project (https://github.com/Rethdawg/loyal_companion).

## Description

This webapp will function as a user's 'homepage', where they can track information of interest to their daily life. It will allow the user to:
- Show the user a weather forecast, and allow them to retrieve forecasts for regions of interest;
- Save and edit memos with multimedia, links, pictures;
- Maintain a to-do list with due dates and reminders;
- Have an RSS feed and customise it;
- Convert currency and see most recent rates from the central european bank;
- Perhaps more!

## Purpose of the project

Practice and learn more web development, Django, Javascript, HTML/CSS and etc.

## Goals of rewrite
I have decided to rewrite the project instead of refactoring it for several reasons:

- **Standartisation.** When I started the original project, it included a lot of experimentation, as I learned while developing it. Some apps within the original project tackled the same challenges with different executions, were written without making full use of unit tests, were rushed or relied on bruteforcing some functionality.
- **New fundamental features.** I plan to add a user log-in system, as well as implement PostgreSQL rather than SQLite to handle user-specific databases.
- **Better practices establishment.** I want to get used to better coding practices as I work. Not being tied to a fast-approaching deadline will allow for more time to research and practice new skills.
